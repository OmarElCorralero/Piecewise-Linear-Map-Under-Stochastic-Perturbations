# Piecewise-Linear-Map-Under-Stochastic-Perturbations
This repository contains a pdf with all the research done on a piecewise linear map with stochastic perturbations together with a Python Jupyter code (simple version) to study phase portraits.
The model used is a generalization of the map studied by Robert L. Devaney in 1984 called “‘Gingerbreadman”’. This code has the possibility to study both the deterministic version of the dynamics and the stochastic version.
In Python Jupyter, different perturbations are obtained at each run.
