# Gingerbreadman Map Analysis with Stochastic Perturbations

This repository contains a **numerical and computational study** of a **piecewise linear map under stochastic perturbations**, based on a generalization of the classical "Gingerbreadman" map studied by **Robert L. Devaney in 1984**.  

The work is part of a research investigation, with a **PDF report** included in this repository detailing the theoretical and computational aspects.

## üß© Background

The **Gingerbreadman map**, introduced by Robert L. Devaney in 1984, is a simple but rich example of a **piecewise linear chaotic map** in discrete dynamical systems.  

In this project, the model is **generalized and studied under stochastic perturbations**, allowing exploration of how random fluctuations affect the dynamics.  

Key objectives include:

- Investigating the **stability and behavior** of the generalized map.
- Visualizing trajectories under different perturbation strengths.
- Exploring **chaotic and quasi-periodic regimes** numerically.
